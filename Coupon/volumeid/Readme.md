### Volumeid Program Fix

Volumeid.exe is a really good program at changing a hard drive's serial number.

While Windows NT/2000 and Windows 95 and 98's built-in Label utility lets you change the labels of disk volumes, it does not provide any means for changing volume ids. This utiltity, VolumeID, allows you to change the ids of FAT and NTFS disks (floppies or hard drives).

Usage: `volumeid <driveletter:> xxxx-xxxx`

This is a command-line program that you must run from a command-prompt window.

Note that changes on NTFS volumes won't be visible until the next reboot.<br> 
In addition, you should shut down any applications you have running before changing a volume id. <br>
