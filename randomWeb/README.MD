# randomWeb
You can compile this file into an exe by locating the `jsc.exe` (JavaScript Compiler) file on your system and pass it the filename. 

`jsc.exe randomWeb.js`

It seems like any PC with DotNet Frameworks installed will have the file.

The program uses the common vowels and common consonants and builds random words between 3 and 12 letters long, then appends `.com` to it.

The array of vowels are:
`"a", "a", "e", "e", "e", "i", "o", "o", "u", "y"`<br>
The array of consonants are:
`"c", "d", "f", "h", "l", "m", "n", "r", "s", "t`<br>
